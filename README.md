## Overview

This project serves as an example of how to structure a Node.js application using Clean Architecture principles. It separates concerns into different layers such as domain, data, and presentation, providing a clear and maintainable codebase.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `src/domain`: Contains domain entities, use cases, and interfaces.
- `src/data`: Manages data access, repositories, and data sources.
- `src/interfaces`: Defines interfaces for repositories, data sources, and use cases.
- `src/routes`: Handles HTTP routes and controllers.
- `src/app.ts`: Entry point for the application.
- ...

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Web application framework for Node.js.
- [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2): MySQL library for Node.js.
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/): Promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
